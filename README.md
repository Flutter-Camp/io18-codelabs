# IO18 Codelabs
Ordered walkthrough of new 2018 Google I/O Codelabs on Flutter: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/io2018?cat=Flutter

Before getting started, walk through the [Flutter install](https://flutter.io/get-started/install/) procedure (if new) or run ```flutter upgrade``` if you already have Flutter installed locally. 

As I found out [when trying some labs at IO](https://twitter.com/nitya/status/994698313818501120), having the latest Flutter version can save you a lot of debug hassle. Here is my current version/distribution status.

```
