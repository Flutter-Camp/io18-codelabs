### Flutter Setup

Install Flutter prior to starting codelabs. You can use the [Flutter install guide](https://flutter.io/get-started/install/) for a fresh install, and the Flutter CLI _upgrade_ utility to keep the distribution up to date. 

I originally installed Flutter during its _alpha_ release, reinstalled at the first _beta_ and regularly run ```flutter upgrade``` to keep it current. 

Here is my current status (6/7/2018):

```
$ flutter upgrade
